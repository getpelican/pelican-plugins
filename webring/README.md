# Webring Plugin

This plugin retrieves the latest posts from a list of web feeds and makes
them available in templates, effectively creating a [partial webring][1]. Posts
are sorted from newer to older.

It is inspired by [openring](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring), a tool for
generating an HTML file to include in your [SSG][2] from a template and a list of
web feeds.

## Requirements

It requires the `feedparser` module:

    $ pip install feedparser

`feedparser` supports many common and not so common feed formats (e.g RSS/Atom). [See a list here](https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/introduction.html).

## Settings

```
WEBRING_FEED_URLS = []
```
A list of web feeds in the form of a URL or local file.

```
WEBRING_SUPPORT_HTTPS = True
```
Support HTTPS. It's enabled by default because most websites currently use HTTPS.

_Nevertheless, you must be aware of the fact that this setting works by
creating a global unverified https context. This means that any other
http request made by pelican core and pelican plugins will not fail in case of
an invalid SSL certificate. This is due to
[a limitation in the feedparser module](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/issues/84)._

```
WEBRING_MAX_ARTICLES = 3
```
The maximum number of articles.

```
WEBRING_ARTICLES_PER_FEED = 1
```
The maximum number of articles per feed.

```
WEBRING_SUMMARY_LENGTH = 128
```
The maximum length of post summaries.

```
WEBRING_CLEAN_SUMMARY_HTML = True
```
Whether to clean html tags from post summaries or not.

### Example
Let's suppose we have two blogs in our webring and want to show two articles
per blog. We would also like to show a quite short summary.

```
WEBRING_FEED_URLS = [
    'https://justinmayer.com/feeds/all.atom.xml',
    'https://danluu.com/atom.xml'
]
WEBRING_ARTICLES_PER_FEED = 2
WEBRING_MAX_ARTICLES = 4
WEBRING_SUMMARY_LENGTH = 25
```

## Templates
The plugin makes available the resulting web feed articles in the variable
`webring_articles`, which is a list of `Article` objects whose attributes are:

- `title`: The article title.
- `link`: The article URL.
- `date`: The article date as a Pelican `utils.SafeDatetime` object, which can
be used with [Pelican's Jinja filter `strftime`](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/themes.html#date-formatting).
- `summary`: The article summary, as provided in the web feed and modified
according to this plugin's settings.
- `source_title`: The title of the web feed.
- `source_link`: A link to the web feed.
- `source_id`: An identification field provided in some web feeds.

See the following section for an example on how to iterate the article list.

### Example
Imagine we'd like to put our webring in the bottom of the default Pelican
template (ie. notmyidea). To simplify, we'll use the existing CSS classes.

Edit the `notmyidea/templates/base.html` file and make it look like this:

```
        ...
        <section id="extras" class="body">
        {% if WEBRING_FEED_URLS %}
            <div class="webring">
                <h2>Webring</h2>
                {% for article in webring_articles %}
                <p><a href="{{ article.link }}">{{ article.title }}</a></p>
                <p>{{ article.date|strftime('%d %B %Y') }} - {{ article.summary}}</p>
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
        {% endif %}
        {% if LINKS %}
        ...
```

If there were no links or social widgets, the result would be like in the
