# Libravatar plugin for Pelican

## Description

This plugin allows the inclusion of [Libravatar](http://www.libravatar.org)
user profile pictures, according to the email address of the article's
author.

## Usage

### Specifying the author's email address

The default email address is taken from the `LIBRAVATAR_AUTHOR_EMAIL`
variable in the Pelican configuration file.  This default value can be
overridden in a per-article basis, according to the email address found in
the article's metadata.

In ReSTructuredText:

```rst
:email: bart.simpson@example.com
```

In Markdown:

```markdown
Email: bart.simpson@example.com
```

If the avatar for the specified email address is not found at Libravatar,
it is searched at [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com).  If it is not found
there neither, a default picture is shown.  The default for the "missing
picture" can be defined in the configuration variable `LIBRAVATAR_MISSING`.

### Adjusting the template

This plugin assigns the `author_libravatar` variable to the Libravatar URL
and makes the variable available within the article's context.  For
instance, you can add the following to a template file (for example, to the
`article_infos.html` template file of the notmyidea theme), just before the
infomation about the author:

```html
{% if article.author_libravatar %}
<div align="center">
        <img src="{{ article.author_libravatar }}">
</div>
{% endif %}
```

## Settings

The following variables can be set in the Pelican configuration file:

- `LIBRAVATAR_AUTHOR_EMAIL`: site-wide default for the author's email address.

- `LIBRAVATAR_MISSING`: The default for the missing picture.  This can be
either a url (e.g. `'http://example.com/nobody.png'`) or the name of a
library of logos (e.g. `'wavatar'`; for the full set of alternativas, see
the [Libravatar API](https://wiki.libravatar.org/api/)).

- `LIBRAVATAR_SIZE`: The size, in pixels, of the profile picture (it is
always square, so the height is equal to the width).  If not specified, the
default size (80Ã—80) is returned by Libravatar.
