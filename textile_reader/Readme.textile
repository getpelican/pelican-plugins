h1. Textile Reader Plugin for Pelican

p. This plugin adds support for "Textile markup":https://github.com/netcarver/textile via the "textile egg on pypi":https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile .

p. Input files are similar in format to Markdown files, in that they start with the post metadata in "Key: value" pairs, one per line. However, the metadata is ended by a line containing only "----", and then all that follows is the body content.  If the separator line is missing then the whole file is assumed to be content.
