*This fork is a prototype to demo an alternate way of organizing and
presenting the pelican-plugins repo in way that is easier to track and
understand the difference between pre- and and post- Pelican v4.5 plugins.*

*The default branch has been renamed to ``main`` from ``master`` to ensure
people learn about the post-v4.5 migration and only use legacy plugins on purpose.*

*To make this demo 'real' search and replace ``github.com/maphew`` with 
``github.com/getpelican`` and delete these paragraphs before merging
the Pull Request.*

Legacy Pelican Plugins
######################

This is the readme for legacy plugins prior to release of Pelican v4.5. Please see
main plugins `Readme`_ for 4.5+ and the new namespace plugins found at the
`Pelican Plugins`_ organization.

.. _Readme: Readme.rst
.. _Pelican Plugins: https://github.com/pelican-plugins

How to use plugins
==================

To install and use these plugins clone this repo and branch::

    git clone --branch legacy --recursive https://github.com/maphew/pelican-plugins

and activate the ones you want in your settings file::

    PLUGIN_PATHS = ['path/to/pelican-plugins']
    PLUGINS = ['assets', 'sitemap', 'gravatar']

``PLUGIN_PATHS`` can be a path relative to your settings file or an absolute path.

Alternatively, if plugins are in an importable path, you can omit ``PLUGIN_PATHS``
and list them::

    PLUGINS = ['assets', 'sitemap', 'gravatar']

or you can ``import`` the plugin directly and give that::

    import my_plugin
    PLUGINS = [my_plugin, 'assets']
