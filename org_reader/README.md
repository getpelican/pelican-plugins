- `ORG_READER_EMACS_SETTINGS`: Optional. An absolute path to an Elisp file, to
  run per invocation. Useful for initializing the `package` Emacs library if
  that's where your Org mode comes from, or any modifications to Org Export-
  related variables. If you want to use your standard emacs init file, you 
  can ignore this variable.

  to 'html.
